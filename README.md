# Basic information of the dataset

We constructed a new dataset called the Mouse Cardiac Infarction Image Dataset, which includes 243 images. According to the mouse of myocardial injury, we collected 243 cardiac slice images from C57BL/6 mice. These images were captured by the camera with a size of 6,000 Ã— 4,000 pixels. After coronary artery ligation surgery, their cardiac were removed and sliced. Each mouse's cardiac was cut into five slices, resulting in 1215 mouse cardiac slices. Each group of 5 slices formed a complete image.

# Quantitative measurement methods and staining effects

To quantitatively measure the infarct size, we performed triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) and Evans blue staining on each cardiac slice. TTC staining colors active cardiac tissue red to depict risk and infarct areas. Meanwhile, Evans Blue will dye the surviving cardiac tissue blue. Therefore, non-ischemic areas are colored blue, dangerous areas are colored red, and infarcted areas are marked white.

#  Dataset characteristics

In addition, this dataset is the first mouse cardiac image dataset that covers the left ventricle, danger zone, and infarct zone.
